vdb is a C++ library that lets you easily create interactive 2D/3D visualization breakpoints. It can be used for things like:

* Analyzing intermediate results in steps of an algorithm
* Visualizing and pre-processing 2D and 3D input data
* Prototyping a GUI application for annotating data

vdb runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS, and requires only an OpenGL 3.1 compatible GPU (which even really old laptops have).

**Basic example**

vdb works like a breakpoint debugger:

* you set breakpoints in your code by declaring named "blocks".
* your visualization code goes inside the block.
* inside the block you can access variables from outside.

For example, here's a program that opens a window and clears the background color to red using data outside the breakpoint block.

```c++
#include <vdb.h>
int main(int, char**) {
    float color[3] = { 1.0f, 0.3f, 0.1f };

    VDBB("Test window");
    vdbClear(color[0], color[1], color[2], 1.0f);
    VDBE();

    return 0;
}
```

This program only has one breakpoint, but your program can have many. As with a normal debugger, you can resume control flow and step to the next breakpoint.

**Quick start**

For a quick start, compile and run [test/test.cpp](test/test.cpp) by following the instructions inside the file. This is a self-contained program that uses the library to show off basic usage patterns.

**Using vdb in your project**

Once you are able to compile and run [test/test.cpp](test/test.cpp) you should be good to go integrate the library into your own project! Here are some tips to get you further:

* Use [test/Makefile](test/Makefile) or [test/build.bat](test/build.bat) to build vdb in with your application

* Learn to use vdb by running the **interactive guide** [test/test.cpp](test/test.cpp) and following along in the source code.

* Learn to use **Dear ImGui** by visiting its [project page](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/).

**Using vdb in other languages**

vdb is currently a C++ library, but it should be possible to create bindings to other languages (such as Python). If anyone would like to assist with this I would gladly accept pull requests.
